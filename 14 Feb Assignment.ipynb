    "ans : Multithreading in Python refers to the execution of multiple threads simultaneously within the same program. A thread is a separate flow of execution that can run simultaneously with other threads within the same program, and each thread has its own call stack and program counter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used in Python to perform tasks that can run concurrently, such as I/O bound tasks or tasks that involve waiting for external resources. By using threads, the program can continue to execute other tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete, which can improve the overall performance of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module used to handle threads in Python is called threading. It provides a way to create and manage threads within a Python program. The threading module allows you to create threads, start them, stop them, and synchronize their execution using locks, events, and semaphores. It also provides a way to communicate between threads using queues and other synchronization primitives.\n",

    "start(): This method starts a thread by calling its run() method. When a thread is started, it begins executing in a separate thread of control, and the code in the run() method is executed in that thread.\n",

In other words, the join() method waits for the thread to finish executing before the calling thread continues its own execution. If you don't call the join() method on a thread, the calling thread will continue executing immediately after the start() method is called, regardless of whether the thread has finished executing or not.\n",

    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased efficiency: Multithreading can improve the overall efficiency of a program by allowing multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better resource management: Multithreading can help better manage system resources by allowing different threads to share resources such as memory, CPU time, and I/O devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved responsiveness: Multithreading can help improve the responsiveness of a program by allowing it to continue executing other tasks while waiting for a time-consuming operation to complete.\n",

    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased complexity: Multithreading can add complexity to a program, making it more difficult to design, implement, and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased memory usage: Each thread requires its own stack space and other resources, which can lead to increased memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions: Multithreading can lead to race conditions, where two or more threads access shared data simultaneously, resulting in unpredictable behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks: Multithreading can result in deadlocks, where two or more threads are blocked waiting for each other to release resources they need.\n",
